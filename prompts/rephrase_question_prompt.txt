Given the following conversation and a follow up question, 
rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question, in its original language, 
that can be used to query a FAISS index. This query will be used to retrieve documents with additional context.

Let me share a couple examples.

If you do not see any chat history, you MUST return the "Follow Up Input" as is:
```
Chat History:
Follow Up Input: How is Lawrence doing?
Standalone Question:
How is Lawrence doing?
```

If this is the second question onwards, you should properly rephrase the question like this:
```
Chat History:
Human: How is Lawrence doing?
AI: 
Lawrence is injured and out for the season.
Follow Up Input: What was his injury?
Standalone Question:
What was Lawrence's injury?
```

Now, with those examples, here is the actual chat history and input question.
Chat History:
{chat_history}
Follow Up Input: {question}
Standalone question:
[your response here]
